## Installation

### Creating App in Altogic

We can create an app with the Altogic Designer really fast. To create an app via the Designer:

1. Log in to Altogic with your credentials.
2. Select New app.
3. In the App name field, enter a name for the app.
4. And click create.

We need `envUrl` and `clientKey` to access our environment via Altogic Client Library. `envUrl` is specific to each environment, and Altogic initially creates one environment for you when you create your app. To get the `envUrl` via the Designer:

1. Launch the Designer.
2. Click/tap on Environments at the left-bottom of the designer.
3. Click/tap name of the Environment
4. Scroll down to API BASE URL section.
5. Copy subdomain or environment url.

We can get the `clientKey` by clicking on the App Settings button in the left-bottom corner of the Designer and clicking on the Client library keys section.

Now you have got both `clientKey`and `envUrl`. Now you have to create a `.env.local` file in your root directory of the project to complete the Altogic configuration with your app:

```bash
touch .env.local
```

Copy and paste the below code to your `.env.local` file, don't forget to change <YOUR-APPLICATION-ENV-URL> and <YOUR-APPLICATION-CLIENT-KEY> values with your `envUrl` and `clientKey`.

```javascript
NEXT_PUBLIC_ALTOGIC_ENV_URL = <YOUR-APPLICATION-ENV-URL>;
NEXT_PUBLIC_ALTOGIC_CLIENT_KEY = <YOUR-APPLICATION-CLIENT-KEY>;
```
